Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening in the InterPlanetary File System galaxy!

Decentralized Uniswap Interface Hosting on IPFS

Uniswap has merged the code to continuously deploy its interface on Crust Network! Hosting a website/DApp frontend on IPFS grants you several benefits, such as serverless hosting, potential resilience to DNS hijacks (together with IPNS/ENS), and high uptime. Uniswap, as one of the most widely used DEX‚Äôs (Decentralized Exchange), has been integrated with IPFS for approximately a year. This article explains the whole process in more detail, and also describes how to host a website in a more decentralized way using Crust.
